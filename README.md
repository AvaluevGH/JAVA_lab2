Development of the simplest application with windowed interface
Unlike a console application, an application with a graphical (windowed) interface has one or more top windows level (i.e. windows that are not nested within other windows),
called frames in Java.
Note: since in this work only windows are considered top level, the frame and window will be used synonymously.
